            Hi there, I'am Usman
          </h1>
          <p className='py-4 text-lg tracking-wider'>
            I am a full stack web developer based in Stockholm with a passion
            for building web and mobile applications. I have a strong background
            in designing and open to new challenges. I am a fast learner and
            always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
            <br />
            <br />
            Growing up, whenever someone asked me what my dream was, I would
            always say, ‚ÄúI want to be an artist‚Äù. I was constantly immersed in
            creative activities - writing poetries, lyrics, designing, and
            daydreaming about what I could create next. While in the midst of
            all that, technology started to become a big part of my life as
            well, and my interest in the constantly evolving digital world
            continued to grow. <br />
            <br />
            Previously, I worked as an UX/UI developer at SustainLab. My
            experiences in that role have sharpened my skills in digital design,
            working in a fast paced, high-pressure environment, empathizing with
            people, doing research and analysis, identifying goals and needs,
            and efficiently finding solutions to a broad variety of problems and
            user pain points.

              How did i get into web development?
            </span>
            <br />I was always interested in a career in tech, but didn't know
            how to get started. I was working as a UX/UI developer at
            SustainLab, and was looking for a way to expand my skillset. I then
            started to learn how to code, and I fell in love with it. I was able
            to apply my design skills along with code, and I was able to create
            things that I never thought I could. I decided to make a career
            change, and now I am a full stack web developer.
