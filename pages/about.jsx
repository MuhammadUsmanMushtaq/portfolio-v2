          I am a fullstack software developer based in stockholm with a passion
          for building web and mobile applications. I have a strong background
          in designing and I am open to new challenges. I am a fast learner and
          I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
          <br />
          <br />
          Growing up, whenever someone asked me what my dream was, I would
          always say, ‚ÄúI want to be an artist‚Äù. I was constantly immersed in
          creative activities - writing poetries, lyrics, designing, and
          daydreaming about what I could create next. While in the midst of all
          that, technology started to become a big part of my life as well, and
          my interest in the constantly evolving digital world continued to
          grow. <br />
          <br />
          Previously, I worked as an UX/UI developer at SustainLab. My
          experiences in that role have sharpened my skills in digital design,
          working in a fast paced, high-pressure environment, empathizing with
          people, doing research and analysis, identifying goals and needs, and
          efficiently finding solutions to a broad variety of problems and user
          pain points.

            How did i get into software development?
          </span>
          <br />I was always interested in a career in tech, but I didn't know
          how to get started. I was working as a UX/UI designer at SustainLab,
          and I was looking for a way to expand my skillset. I started to learn
          how to code, and I fell in love with it. I was able to apply my design
          skills to the code, and I was able to create things that I never
          thought I could. I decided to make a career change, and I am now a
          fullstack software developer.
